# tweet-the-vote
A fun little app I built in the fall of 2015 while a student at General Assembly

It's just a basic webpage with css and js animations. It featured the 4 top tier presidential cadidates at the time - along with their twitter stats as they were in early November.

If you want to have a look - and I hope you do - please clone this repo and launch index.html.
